  title: "It's Time To Stop Stalling: Fast and Beautiful Images and Video"

    Immersive experiences are often centered around video and images. With thousands of different devices and screens - how do we design and build experiences that load quickly, but also deliver that eye catching experience? In this talk, we’ll examine strategies to send the perfect image or video to every device, ensuring a fast, beautiful rendering of your content. We’ll look at progressive images, placeholder images, lazy loading, video streaming and more! I'll be using real world examples to show improved delivery of images to your site or app.

    Doug ([https://dougsillars.com/](https://dougsillars.com/)) has been working with developers to improve mobile performance for many years. The author of O’Reilly’s “High Performance Android Apps,” Doug has spoken at developer conferences across the US and Europe. He is currently working as a freelance digital nomad, traveling with his family in Europe.

  title: "Fake It 'Til You Make It - Prerendering Image Contents For Fun & Profit"
  author: "Tobias Baldauf"

      Images weigh heavy on our users: they evoke emotions and prompt actions, but they also make up 2/3rds of all website data. Of the median 1700kb of website data, 900kb is taken up by images.

      Some of the key web performance metrics for successful conversions, such as Speed Index, Time To First Meaningful Interaction and Page Load Time suffer from our need for images. To ensure a good user experience, we have to optimize for perceived performance.

      In this session, we will explore several image rendering techniques developed to render image contents as soon as possible so that perceived performance increases and the user experience is positive. These techniques will help us to engage users earlier, leading to lower bounce rates and higher conversions.

      Tobias is a tech domain lead at trivago. He creates DevOps tools, image optimization algorithms & speaks at conferences. He's a dedicated dad & mindful musician.

This month will be special! Not only can we welcome two internationally reknown speakers in the area of performance related topics, this time we'll also join forces with the lovely people from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Web-Engineering-Duesseldorf/">Web Engineering DUS</a> and run the June meetup together with them. So unless you happen to regularly visit both meetups, expect to see a whole lot of new faces around you - a good opportunity to get to learn them! The event happens at the usual place at our lovely host Sipgate (details at the bottom). What differs is that the whole meetup will be run in English this time.

So what do we have cooked up for you?
