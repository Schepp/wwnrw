  author: Kadir Topal

  description: |
Remote user testing is a cheap and simple way to tighten feedback loops and increase confidence in design decision; yet, few people actually use it on a regular basis. Kadir will show us how his team has used remote user testing to develop features for MDN web docs and how you can incorporate it in your workflow with minimal overhead.

Being product manager of MDN Web Docs at Mozilla, Kadir will also gladly chat with you about the new developments around MDN and how anyone of us can become a contributor to help shape an even better web.
