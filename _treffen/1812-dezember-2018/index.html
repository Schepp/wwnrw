        As a web developer it's easy to feel intimidated by the world of hardware hacking and the physical web, we have to leave our comfort zone and need to get familiar with a completely new development environment. But not anymore, thanks to wonderful possibilities that the WebUSB API brings to our browsers.

        In this talk Sebastian will give an intro to the endless wonders we can encounter in the hardware world through our browser windows. Aside from learning the basics of USB and serial port communication, we'll paint on USB displays, live tweet to receipt printers, control an Arduino, steal data from Android phones and many moreâ€¦ The only limit is your imagination.

        Imagine, sitting at some Christmas Special event and then there is no mulled wine!!1elf! Not good. But we can brew some ourselves! All we need is slam together an IoT controlled machine and hook that
up to our browser so that we can send it the recipe. But beware, there might be fire involved. And things could become a mess. Or fail miserably. Who knows?
