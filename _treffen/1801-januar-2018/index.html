      You might already use desktop software written in JavaScript: Popular apps like Atom, Slack, or Visual Studio Code use the framework Electron to combine the power of the Desktop with the convenience of coding for Node.js.

      You'll learn how to build native-feeling desktop apps for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux. In fact, we'll build a little code editor together - fully integrated with operating systems and tweaked use native code where necessary. We'll talk about the basics, advanced scenarios, and leveraging the full power of npm and Node.

      Felix Rieseberg is Senior Desktop Engineer at Slack in San Francisco, working full-time on open source projects like Electron, npm, or Ghost. If he's not contributing, he's out in the world talking about open source.
