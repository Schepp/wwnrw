Text: Have you ever been wondering how large scale web applications like Facebook or Instagram are built?

If so, this workshop is just right for you! We will give you an introduction to the latest thrills of JavaScript development with EcmaScript 2016. After that, you'll learn how React and Redux form an architecture for building complex web applications.

You'll learn how to leverage React in order to develop a clean component architecture for your frontend. You'll also learn how to use Redux in order to keep your frontend and backend in sync. If there's time left we'll show you modern tooling (Webpack, Karma) that enables fast paced development and is optimized for developer happiness.

##On our agenda:

First, we will give you a crash course in the latest version of JavaScript. After that, we'll teach you about the individual components of the architecture:

* React, so you can develop kick ass frontends
* CSS-Modules, so you can stay on top of an application that has more than 100 components
* Redux, for your mental sanity while modeling your app state
* React-Router, so you understand how complex apps are composed

After some theory we'll do some live coding and develop a demo application together.

**Target audience:** People that already feel comfortable with ES5 JavaScript and npm-based tooling.

**Stuff you need to bring along:** A laptop, if you want to do a bit of coding yourself.

**PS:** Regular meetup visitors, please note that this workshop is happening on Wednesday, Mai 11th! Not on Thursday when our meetup would normally take place.
